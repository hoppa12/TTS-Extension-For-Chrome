# TTS-Extension-For-Chrome

This is basically a copy of my other TTS Extension for Yandex Mobile with one minor difference.

# Description
I find the layout of a mobile device has a much more intuitive layout for making use of TTS, since the screens layout is top to bottom.
To use this extension, Chrome has to be in mobile view, to do this, open developer tools( crl+shift+i) and select the mobile button on the
top left of the tools screen.

You may need to refresh the page, now you can double click on a part of the page and this extension will read out loud from that point until the
the end of the page.
